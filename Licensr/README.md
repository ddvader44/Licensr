# Licensr
## Inspiration
We were thinking about creating a software and then were worried about it getting pirated, so we thought of this idea which could prevent software piracy.
## What it does
Licensr is a one stop application for license generation, transfer and authentication using blockchain technology. The plan is to issue licenses as NFTs which can be transferred to consumer's wallets and proper authentication can be ensured. The client company can issue any number of License tokens according to their need and sell them to their consumers. We plan to provide an API which will receive the License token address and a wallet address and send a response if the token belongs to the given address. This implementation will greatly reduce software piracy and will provide an easy way to handle licenses. This also has an added advantage that the licenses can be resold by the customers and retail of products will become much easier. The company can set commission rates for resales and earn passive income easily.
## How we built it
We built this using solidity programming language, MERN Stack and ethereum blockchain.
## Challenges we ran into
Integrating backend with solidity code with web3js
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We successfully deployed our smart contract on ethereum test network
## What we learned
We learnt about blockchain technology, how to write smart contracts and a little bit of web development
## What's next for Licensr
We plan to extend this idea to audio, video and photo protection.
